Imbecile. Their form is crude and their minds are fueled off of anger and malice. But I must thank him, a mindless creature is a perfect vessel for another shardbearer, and I think I know just the place. Dol'Naer was once a beacon reaching to the stars in days long since past, and now it shall be the birthplace of my dynasty. Welcome, Drakon, bearer of the shard of wrath.\"\n\n- Eternal Tyrant of Shadow",
